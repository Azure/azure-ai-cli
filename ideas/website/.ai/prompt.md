# Instructions:
In this directory there are some files for a website. To build the website, you need to run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npx webpack
```

Then to run the website, launch `index.html` in your browser.

I want this directory to also have the appropriate support files for VS Code, so that I can build and run the website from within VS Code.

# Task you must perform
1. Please read all the files in the current directory, to understand what we've done so far. Do that now.
2. Please follow the instructions above for the next step. Do that now.

Don't show me the code, just create the files. Do it now.
