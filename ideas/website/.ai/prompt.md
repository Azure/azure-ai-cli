# Instructions:
In this directory there are some files for a website. To build the website, you need to run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npx webpack
```

Then to run the website, launch `index.html` in your browser.

These are represented in tasks.json and launch.json, so that you can build and run the website from within VS Code.

However, inside `script.js`, i have some "secrets" hard-coded... What's a better idiomatic way to deal with them, if I both want to:
(a) keep them secret when I deploy to a static file serving website, and
(b) make it very easy for a developer to run the website locally, without having to set up a server?


# Task you must perform
1. Please read all the files in the current directory, to understand what we've done so far. Do that now.
2. Please follow the instructions above for the next step. Do that now.

Don't show me the code, just create the files. Do it now.
