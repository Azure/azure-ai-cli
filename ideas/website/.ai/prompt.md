# Background
In this directory there are some files for a website. To build the website, you need to run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npx webpack
```

Then to run the website, launch `index.html` in your browser.

These are represented in tasks.json and launch.json, so that you can build and run the website from within VS Code.

There's a README.md with some draft information in it. 

# Task you must perform
1. Please read all the files in the current directory, to understand what we've done so far. Do that now.
2. Please update the README.md file to follow typical idiomatic conventions for a README.md file. Do that now.

Don't show me the code, just create the files. Do it now.
