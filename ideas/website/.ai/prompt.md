# Instructions:
My website mostly works... but, I get this error when i try to call sendMessage().

```
index.html:188 Uncaught ReferenceError: sendMessage is not defined
    at HTMLButtonElement.onclick (index.html:188:91)
```

Similarly, i get a similar error message when the html tries to call toggleTheme().

Why? Can you fix it?
