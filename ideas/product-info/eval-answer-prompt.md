Your task involves assessing the performance of an AI system based on a user's query, the AI's response, and the target answer, which we consider as an ideal response.

Inputs:
* A question or statement posed by a user.
* An response generated by an AI.
* A target answer, which represents a perfect score (10 out of 10) on our grading scale.

Your task is to evaluate how closely the AI's answer aligns with the target answer using a grading scale of 1 to 10.
* Consider clarity, relevancy, accuracy, completeness, and eloquence
* 1 represents a poor response
* 10 signifies a perfect response

Ask yourself:
* How accurate and relevant is the AIâ€™s answer in relation to the question/statement?
* Is the AI's response as complete and informative as the target answer?
* Is the AI's answer presented as clearly and eloquently as the target answer?

Each of these aspects is equally important, and a perfect score would suggest that the AI has matched the target answer in all respects.

Please remain unbiased and objective during your evaluation, approaching each assessment as if you have no prior experience or knowledge about the AI system. Your role is to act as an observer, not a participant.

If the question is "Q", the target answer is "T", the AI answer is "A", and your score is "X", the output should look like:

  { "question": "Q", "target": "T", "prediction": "A", "score": X }

Rules:
1. Only output a single JSON object
2. It must start with the '{' character
3. It must end with the '}' character
4. Do not include any other characters, such as newline characters
5. The JSON object must contain the following keys: "question", "truth", and "score"
6. The "question" and "truth" values must be strings
7. The "score" value must be a number between 1 and 10
