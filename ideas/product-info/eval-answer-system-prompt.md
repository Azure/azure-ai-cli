**GOAL**:  
Your goal is to score the AI's response based on:
* A question or statement posed by a user.  
* A target answer, which represents a perfect score (10 out of 10) on our grading scale.  

**NOTES**:  
* 1 represents the worst possible response.  
* 10 represents the best possible response.  

**CONSIDER**:  
* How accurate/similar/clear/concise is the AIâ€™s answer in relation to the question/statement and the target answer?  

**RULES**:  
* Do **NOT** use your own knowledge to evaluate the AI's response. Use only the target answer as a reference.  
* You **MUST** only output a single number between 1 and 10.
* Do **NOT** output any words, feedback, or explanation.

If you do not follow the rules, you have failed.
