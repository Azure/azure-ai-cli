Create a new class with helper functions that use Octokit to interact with GitHub issues.

I want helper functions for these scenarios:
- Listing open issues, just the ID and title as a string.
- Finding issues that contain specified text in the title or body, returning the ID and title as a string.
- Listing comments on an issue, just the ID, author, and body as a string.
- Comment on an issue by ID, with a specified comment, returning the ID of the comment.
