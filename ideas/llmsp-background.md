I want to make a "client/server" interaction protocol similar to the "Language Server Protocol" used by VS Code. In mine, though, instead of focusing on the scenario of "code completions", "code formatting", etc., it will be a "Gen AI" type scenario where the servers will offer up functionality that can be used by any CLI that's using Gen AI (such as GH Copilot extension in GH CLI, AZD CLI, AZ CLI, GIT, GREP, etc.). Imagine that this new SP is called LLMSP (or GenAiSP). 

I'm a program manager at Microsoft, and I need to write a specification that describes what the LLMSP is, why we need it, how it works, etc. That's where I need your help. 

I've compiled some key artifacts to use as inputs for this specification. They're copied below.

# Language Server Extension Guide

As you have seen in the Programmatic Language Features topic, it's possible to implement Language Features by directly using languages.* API. Language Server Extension, however, provides an alternative way of implementing such language support.

## Why Language Server?
Language Server is a special kind of Visual Studio Code extension that powers the editing experience for many programming languages. With Language Servers, you can implement autocomplete, error-checking (diagnostics), jump-to-definition, and many other language features supported in VS Code.

However, while implementing support for language features in VS Code, we found three common problems:

First, Language Servers are usually implemented in their native programming languages, and that presents a challenge in integrating them with VS Code, which has a Node.js runtime.

Additionally, language features can be resource intensive. For example, to correctly validate a file, Language Server needs to parse a large amount of files, build up Abstract Syntax Trees for them and perform static program analysis. Those operations could incur significant CPU and memory usage and we need to ensure that VS Code's performance remains unaffected.

Finally, integrating multiple language toolings with multiple code editors could involve significant effort. From language toolings' perspective, they need to adapt to code editors with different APIs. From code editors' perspective, they cannot expect any uniform API from language toolings. This makes implementing language support for M languages in N code editors the work of M * N.

To solve those problems, Microsoft specified Language Server Protocol, which standardizes the communication between language tooling and code editor. This way, Language Servers can be implemented in any language and run in their own process to avoid performance cost, as they communicate with the code editor through the Language Server Protocol. Furthermore, any LSP-compliant language toolings can integrate with multiple LSP-compliant code editors, and any LSP-compliant code editors can easily pick up multiple LSP-compliant language toolings. LSP is a win for both language tooling providers and code editor vendors!

## Implementing a Language Server

### Overview

In VS Code, a language server has two parts:

Language Client: A normal VS Code extension written in JavaScript / TypeScript. This extension has access to all VS Code Namespace API.
Language Server: A language analysis tool running in a separate process.
As briefly stated above there are two benefits of running the Language Server in a separate process:

The analysis tool can be implemented in any languages, as long as it can communicate with the Language Client following the Language Server Protocol.
As language analysis tools are often heavy on CPU and Memory usage, running them in separate process avoids performance cost.

Here is an illustration of VS Code running two Language Server extensions. The HTML Language Client and PHP Language Client are normal VS Code extensions written in TypeScript. Each of them instantiates a corresponding Language Server and communicates with them through LSP. Although the PHP Language Server is written in PHP, it can still communicate with the PHP Language Client through LSP.

# Language Server Protocol

## What is the Language Server Protocol?
Supporting rich editing features like source code auto-completions or Go to Definition for a programming language in an editor or IDE is traditionally very challenging and time consuming. Usually it requires writing a domain model (a scanner, a parser, a type checker, a builder and more) in the programming language of the editor or IDE. For example, the Eclipse CDT plugin, which provides support for C/C++ in the Eclipse IDE is written in Java since the Eclipse IDE itself is written in Java. Following this approach, it would mean implementing a C/C++ domain model in TypeScript for Visual Studio Code, and a separate domain model in C# for Visual Studio.

Creating language-specific domain models are also a lot easier if a development tool can reuse existing language-specific libraries. However, these libraries are usually implemented in the programming language itself (for example, good C/C++ domain models are implemented in C/C++). Integrating a C/C++ library into an editor written in TypeScript is technically possible but hard to do.

### Language servers
Another approach is to run the library in its own process and use inter-process communication to talk to it. The messages sent back and forth form a protocol. The language server protocol (LSP) is the product of standardizing the messages exchanged between a development tool and a language server process. Using language servers or demons is not a new or novel idea. Editors like Vim and Emacs have been doing this for some time to provide semantic auto-completion support. The goal of the LSP was to simplify these sorts of integrations and provide a useful framework for exposing language features to a variety of tools.

Having a common protocol allows the integration of programming language features into a development tool with minimal fuss by reusing an existing implementation of the language's domain model. A language server back-end could be written in PHP, Python, or Java and the LSP lets it be easily integrated into a variety of tools. The protocol works at a common level of abstraction so that a tool can offer rich language services without needing to fully understand the nuances specific to the underlying domain model.

## How work on the LSP started
The LSP has evolved over time and today it is at Version 3.0. It started when the concept of a language server was picked up by OmniSharp to provide rich editing features for C#. Initially, OmniSharp used the HTTP protocol with a JSON payload and has been integrated into several editors including Visual Studio Code.

Around the same time, Microsoft started to work on a TypeScript language server, with the idea of supporting TypeScript in editors like Emacs and Sublime Text. In this implementation, an editor communicates through stdin/stdout with the TypeScript server process and uses a JSON payload inspired by the V8 debugger protocol for requests and responses. The TypeScript server has been integrated into the TypeScript Sublime plugin and VS Code for rich TypeScript editing.

After having integrated two different language servers, the VS Code team started to explore a common language server protocol for editors and IDEs. A common protocol enables a language provider to create a single language server that can be consumed by different IDEs. A language server consumer only has to implement the client side of the protocol once. This results in a win-win situation for both the language provider and the language consumer.

The language server protocol started with the protocol used by the TypeScript server, expanding it with more language features inspired by the VS Code language API. The protocol is backed with JSON-RPC for remote invocation due to its simplicity and existing libraries.

The VS Code team prototyped the protocol by implementing several linter language servers which respond to requests to lint (scan) a file and return a set of detected warnings and errors. The goal was to lint a file as the user edits in a document, which means that there will be many linting requests during an editor session. It made sense to keep a server up and running so that a new linting process did not need to be started for each user edit. Several linter servers were implemented, including VS Code's ESLint and TSLint extensions. These two linter servers are both implemented in TypeScript/JavaScript and run on Node.js. They share a library that implements the client and server part of the protocol.

## How the LSP works
A language server runs in its own process, and tools like Visual Studio or VS Code communicate with the server using the language protocol over JSON-RPC. Another advantage of the language server operating in a dedicated process is that performance issues related to a single process model are avoided. The actual transport channel can either be stdio, sockets, named pipes, or node ipc if both the client and server are written in Node.js.

Below is an example for how a tool and a language server communicate during a routine editing session:

lsp flow diagram

* The user opens a file (referred to as a document) in the tool: The tool notifies the language server that a document is open ('textDocument/didOpen'). From now on, the truth about the contents of the document is no longer on the file system but kept by the tool in memory.

* The user makes edits: The tool notifies the server about the document change ('textDocument/didChange') and the semantic information of the program is updated by the language server. As this happens, the language server analyzes this information and notifies the tool with the detected errors and warnings ('textDocument/publishDiagnostics').

* The user executes "Go to Definition" on a symbol in the editor: The tool sends a 'textDocument/definition' request with two parameters: (1) the document URI and (2) the text position from where the Go to Definition request was initiated to the server. The server responds with the document URI and the position of the symbol's definition inside the document.

* The user closes the document (file): A 'textDocument/didClose' notification is sent from the tool, informing the language server that the document is now no longer in memory and that the current contents is now up to date on the file system.

This example illustrates how the protocol communicates with the language server at the level of editor features like "Go to Definition", "Find all References". The data types used by the protocol are editor or IDE 'data types' like the currently open text document and the position of the cursor. The data types are not at the level of a programming language domain model which would usually provide abstract syntax trees and compiler symbols (for example, resolved types, namespaces, ...). This simplifies the protocol significantly.

Now let's look at the 'textDocument/definition' request in more detail. Below are the payloads that go between the client tool and the language server for the "Go to Definition" request in a C++ document.

This is the request:

```JSON
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id" : 1,
    "method": "textDocument/definition",
    "params": {
        "textDocument": {
            "uri": "file:///p%3A/mseng/VSCode/Playgrounds/cpp/use.cpp"
        },
        "position": {
            "line": 3,
            "character": 12
        }
    }
}
```

This is the response:

```JSON
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "result": {
        "uri": "file:///p%3A/mseng/VSCode/Playgrounds/cpp/provide.cpp",
        "range": {
            "start": {
                "line": 0,
                "character": 4
            },
            "end": {
                "line": 0,
                "character": 11
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In retrospect, describing the data types at the level of the editor rather than at the level of the programming language model is one of the reasons for the success of the language server protocol. It is much simpler to standardize a text document URI or a cursor position compared with standardizing an abstract syntax tree and compiler symbols across different programming languages.

When a user is working with different languages, VS Code typically starts a language server for each programming language. The example below shows a session where the user works on Java and SASS files.

### Capabilities
Not every language server can support all features defined by the protocol. Therefore, the client and server announces their supported feature set through 'capabilities'. As an example, a server announces that it can handle the 'textDocument/definition' request, but it might not handle the 'workspace/symbol' request. Similarly, clients can announce that they are able to provide 'about to save' notifications before a document is saved, so that a server can compute textual edits to automatically format the edited document.

## Integrating a language server
The actual integration of a language server into a particular tool is not defined by the language server protocol and is left to the tool implementors. Some tools integrate language servers generically by having an extension that can start and talk to any kind of language server. Others, like VS Code, create a custom extension per language server, so that an extension is still able to provide some custom language features.

To simplify the implementation of language servers and clients, there are libraries or SDKs for the client and server parts. These libraries are provided for different languages. For example, there is a language client npm module to ease the integration of a language server into a VS Code extension and another language server npm module to write a language server using Node.js. This is the current list of support libraries.

# What is the Language Server Protocol?

Adding features like auto complete, go to definition, or documentation on hover for a programming language takes significant effort. Traditionally this work had to be repeated for each development tool, as each tool provides different APIs for implementing the same feature.

A Language Server is meant to provide the language-specific smarts and communicate with development tools over a protocol that enables inter-process communication.

The idea behind the Language Server Protocol (LSP) is to standardize the protocol for how such servers and development tools communicate. This way, a single Language Server can be re-used in multiple development tools, which in turn can support multiple languages with minimal effort.

LSP is a win for both language providers and tooling vendors!

## What is LSP?
The Language Server protocol is used between a tool (the client) and a language smartness provider (the server) to integrate features like auto complete, go to definition, find all references and alike into the tool
– official Language Server Protocol specification

The LSP was created by Microsoft to define a common language for programming language analyzers to speak. Today, several companies have come together to support its growth, including Codenvy, Red Hat, and Sourcegraph, and the protocol is becoming supported by a rapidly growing list of editor and language communities. See below for details on and links to current client and server implementations.


## Why LSP?
LSP creates the opportunity to reduce the m-times-n complexity problem of providing a high level of support for any programming language in any editor, IDE, or client endpoint to a simpler m-plus-n problem.

For example, instead of the traditional practice of building a Python plugin for VSCode, a Python plugin for Sublime Text, a Python plugin for Vim, a Python plugin for Sourcegraph, and so on, for every language, LSP allows language communities to concentrate their efforts on a single, high performing language server that can provide code completion, hover tooltips, jump-to-definition, find-references, and more, while editor and client communities can concentrate on building a single, high performing, intuitive and idiomatic extension that can communicate with any language server to instantly provide deep language support.

One more thought, for completeness: 

There is always some potential for new information (new to me) that would alter my belief; I’m actively look for counter points like that now.

I could use your help plugging into broader conversations (if there are any) w/ GH to help cover additional bases on “potential counter points”…

Subject: RE: AI CLI and GH CLI

Short answer: Even considering the broadest interpretation of what GH CLI does with AI, yes, I believe the recommendation remains the same. 
 
More info:
Brannon also works on GH Copilot; we discussed both angles of the GH CLI. I think his views were similar across both scenarios.

Architecturally, at some base layer, yes, there still must be an AI component that “runs on the client side” that underlies all CLIs that are exposing “AI” like scenarios and features.
•	Those features then would show up in GH’s CLI (could be under the model extension or the copilot extension, or both).
•	Also show up in AZD’s CLI (like what Shayne Boyer was proposing during the call on Friday) and likely even under the classic AZ CLI.
•	Additionally, those capabilities should/would show up in places like “shells” / “terminals” we create at Microsoft (like PowerShell, and the Windows Terminal). 
•	In each location they’re “adapted” for the exposure point. This is in some ways like how “text editing facilities” show up in thousands of surfaces in an operating system and other platforms (the TO and CC field, the body, inside Word, in controls in PowerPoint, etc.) But, here we’re talking about a more “developer customer” exposure of “LLM/AI” capabilities, packaged and ready for re-use in all surfaces.  

I need to write this all up a short explanation of what I mean below about this “LLMSP” thing (that’s analogous to the LSP for Language Servers used by Visual Studio and VS Code and are also used in many other surfaces).

I’ll try to write that up early this coming week (I’m traveling tomorrow though, so likely not sharable until Tuesday or Wednesday).

I think we’re taking GH Models too literally to Models rather than the full AI suite. The intent is that anything needed to build an AI application is in VS and GH. A better way to think about it is GH AI not only GH on model scenarios. With that in mind, does your recommendation change?

Worked with Brannon. He still needs to read this final draft, but, I think we’re aligned on the following:

---
Brannon and I met earlier this week to start discussing the possibilities, and we met earlier today to summarize our current “thinking”.

Summary
* We should keep the GH CLI and AI CLI separate, but coherent.
  - GH CLI will focus on GH model scenarios (GH based auth, model selection, inference, etc.)
  - AI CLI will also include Azure capabilities (Azure Auth, model deployments, inference, etc.)
* We will dig deeper to explore, design, and build "code sharing" solutions (medium term)

NOTE: Need to sync with GH models team; GH Model extension ownership is transitioning from Brannon to GH Models team.  
ACTION: Brannon to schedule a meeting with GH Models team engineering and PM owners, including Rob to discuss.  

More details
* Keeping both GH and AI CLIs separate allows us to focus on the unique scenarios and capabilities of each.
* We will ensure that the two CLIs are coherent and consistent in terms of features, terminology, and conventions.
  - This will enable developers to be comfortable when using or switching between the two CLIs.
  - Example 1: parameter names to save or rehydrate a chat history should be the same (--save-chat-history FILE)
  - Example 2: piping output from one CLI to either GH or AI CLI should "work the same" (allow template insertion point, or append, ...)
  - Example 3: advanced usage, such as tool function calling, should be consistent across both CLIs.
  - Example 4: dynamic code generation from templates should be consistent across both CLIs, but flavored for developer specific scenarios.
* We will explore opportunities for shared implementation, and extensibility, in the medium term:
  - Rob's idea is to define and build LLMSP (similar to the Language Server Protocol (LSP) used by VS Code to talk to language servers)
  - This will allow us to build both a code sharing solution, as well as an industry standard for CLI LLM/Chat/Agent clients and servers.
  - We've explored this idea with the PowerShell and Windows Terminal teams, which along with Brannon, Rob, and members of John Maeda's design team.
* We will create one or more cros-divisional workstreams and hierarchical RoB to ensure that we are aligned on GH/AI/AZD CLIs and extensions, and related work.
  - This will include Brannon, Rob, the GH Models team leaders, and others from AI Platform and DevDiv teams.
  - From DevDiv, we will include members of the AI Toolkit team and the owners of the Azure Developer CLI (azd).
  - From AI Platform, we will include engineering + PM leaders for CLIs and extensions (ai, az ml, olive, spx, etc.).
  - We will also include other teams, such as PowerShell, Windows Terminal, VS Code, Cloud shell, and others as needed.

Hey team! I know you both met this week to see if it made sense to combine forces on the AI CLI side. Benefit would be to have one unified push but obviously some draw backs. Curious if you could share where you netted out, esp in the run up to GH Universe and Ignite. Generally I’d love for us to put more wood behind fewer arrows so depending on the audience for each of the CLIs, it’d be great to have one solution if the segments line up. 

Thx

## Additional context

### Integrating w/ other CLIs

In the LLMSP use case, here are things that the LLMSP needs to consider and support:
* AI CLI, GH CLI, AZD CLI, and VS Code's AI Toolkit will be LLMSP clients.
* Additionally, AI CLI, GH CLI, and AZD CLI will be LLMSP servers.
* These and many other CLI servers will offer LLMSP capabilities, such as:
  - Providing function "tools" for other LLMSP clients/servers to use
  - These tools are "atomic" units of functionality that will allow LLMs to "do" things, in CLI and IDE contexts
  - Simple examples:
    * Wrap one or more Semantic Kernel functions in a "tool" that can be called from a CLI or IDE

### VS Code Extensions Contributing Command Palette Commands Used by Other Extensions

#### Examples of Ecosystem Integrations

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) supports a rich ecosystem where extensions can contribute commands to the command palette and expose APIs that other extensions can leverage. This allows for a collaborative environment where functionalities are shared and extended, enhancing the overall developer experience.

Below are some of the top VS Code extensions that contribute command palette commands commonly used by other extensions, along with examples of how they integrate within the ecosystem:

1. Test Explorer UI

   Description: Provides a UI for running tests in VS Code.  
   Ecosystem Integration: Other test framework extensions like Jest Test Explorer, Mocha Test Explorer, and Python Test Explorer use the Test Explorer UI API to display and manage tests within the common interface. This allows developers to run and debug tests from multiple frameworks using a unified UI.

2. Live Share Extension Pack

   Description: Enables real-time collaborative development.  
   Ecosystem Integration: Extensions like Live Share Audio and Live Share Whiteboard integrate with Live Share to enhance collaborative sessions by adding voice communication and shared drawing capabilities.

3. Language Server Protocol Extensions

   Description: Implement the Language Server Protocol (LSP) for language-specific features.  
   Ecosystem Integration: Extensions like vscode-typescript-languageservice expose language features that other extensions can tap into, enabling functionalities like code completion, linting, and refactoring across various languages.

4. Debugger for Chrome

    Description: Allows debugging JavaScript code running in Google Chrome.  
    Ecosystem Integration: Other extensions, such as React Native Tools, leverage this debugger to provide debugging capabilities for React Native applications in Chrome.

5. Prettier - Code Formatter

    Description: An opinionated code formatter supporting multiple languages.  
    Ecosystem Integration: Extensions like Prettier ESLint combine Prettier and ESLint functionalities, using Prettier's formatting commands in conjunction with ESLint's linting capabilities for a seamless code styling experience.

6. ESLint

    Description: Integrates ESLint into VS Code for JavaScript and TypeScript linting.  
    Ecosystem Integration: Extensions like Vue.js Extension Pack and Angular Essentials incorporate ESLint to provide linting support specific to these frameworks, using ESLint's commands for code analysis.

7. Remote Development Extensions

    Ecosystem Integration: Extensions like GitKraken and GitHub Pull Requests and Issues utilize GitLens commands to provide advanced Git features, annotations, and repository insights within their own functionalities.

9. Azure Tools

    Description: Provides a suite of tools for Azure development.  
    Ecosystem Integration: Extensions like Azure Functions and Azure App Service integrate with Azure Tools to offer deployment, debugging, and resource management features, using shared commands for cloud interactions.

10. Python

    Description: Adds rich support for the Python language.  
    Ecosystem Integration: Extensions such as Python Test Explorer and Jupyter utilize the Python extension's commands and APIs to provide testing capabilities and interactive computing support within notebooks.

#### Examples of Ecosystem Integrations

**Testing Frameworks with Test Explorer UI**: By integrating with the Test Explorer UI, various testing extensions provide a consistent experience for running and debugging tests, regardless of the underlying framework.

**Live Share Enhancements**: Extensions enhance Live Share sessions by adding features like voice chat and shared tools, all accessible through the command palette contributed by Live Share.

**Language Features via LSP**: Extensions use language servers provided by other extensions to offer advanced language support without needing to implement these features from scratch.

**Combined Formatting and Linting**: Extensions merge Prettier's formatting commands with ESLint's linting capabilities to enforce code style and quality in a unified way.

**Remote Tooling** Integration: Extensions related to containerization and cloud services integrate with Remote Development commands to offer seamless remote environment support.

#### Why These Integrations Matter

**Enhanced Developer Productivity**: Shared commands and APIs reduce duplication of effort and allow developers to utilize a richer set of tools.  

**Consistent User Experience**: Common interfaces and commands provide a seamless workflow across different extensions.  

**Community Collaboration**: Encourages extension developers to collaborate, building upon each other's work to create more powerful and versatile tools.  

#### Conclusion

These extensions exemplify the collaborative nature of the VS Code ecosystem. By contributing commands to the command palette and exposing APIs, they enable other extensions to integrate and extend functionalities, resulting in a more powerful and cohesive development environment. This synergy not only enhances individual productivity but also drives innovation within the community.
