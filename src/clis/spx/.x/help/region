REGION OVERVIEW

  The Azure Speech Service is REGION specific.

  To find the region for an existing resource:

    (1) Locate the resource on https://portal.azure.com
    (2) Find the ENDPOINT listed on the `Keys and Endpoints` start tab
    (3) Extract the REGION from the ENDPOINT; for example:

        If ENDPOINT == ```https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/...```
        Then REGION == ```westus```.

  For a full list of supported regions, see https://aka.ms/speech/regions.

USAGE: spx <command> [...] --region REGION
   OR: spx <command> [...] --region @FILENAME
   OR: spx <command> [...] @CONFIG-FILENAME

  WHERE: REGION is the name of the region (e.g. westus, eastus, etc.)
     OR: FILENAME is a single line text file containing the REGION
     OR: CONFIG-FILENAME is a single line text file in the following form:

       service.config.region=westus
