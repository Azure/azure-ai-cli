BATCH TRANSCRIPTION ONPREM

  The `spx batch transcription onprem` command enables running against any number of 
  user-supplied Azure Speech Containers.

  NOTE: This command can only be used when running `spx` in its Linux container.
        The container's lifetime must span all the sequence of applied commands.
