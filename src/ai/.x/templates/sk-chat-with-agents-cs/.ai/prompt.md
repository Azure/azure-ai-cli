I will now tell you about a scenario I want to update the code for:

---
{instructions}
---

Task you must perform:
1. Please update the `Program.cs` file with the required changes. Do it now. 
2. Verify that the code compiles and runs without errors. Do it now.
3. If the scenario involves adding new agents, ensure you:
  - Define new agent constants, including their names and instructions.
  - Update the selection strategy to include the new agents and define the rules for their turn-taking.
  - Update the termination strategy, if necessary, to account for the new agents.
  - Instantiate and add the new agents to the `AgentGroupChat` initialization.

Don't show me the code, just create the files. Do it now.
