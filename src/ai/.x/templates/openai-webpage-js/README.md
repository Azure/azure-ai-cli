# `ai` chat website

This is a simple website chat interface that uses OpenAI's API to generate text responses to user input.

User input is typed into a text box and added to the conversation as a message inside a chat panel. The panel scrolls up and the computer responds with streaming text output into another message in the chat panel. There is a left nav that has a "new chat" button and has a spot for future expansion w/ a list of historical chats.

## Setup

To build the website, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npx webpack
```

To run the website, launch `index.html` in your browser.

These setup steps are also represented in tasks.json and launch.json, so that you can build and run the website from within VS Code.
