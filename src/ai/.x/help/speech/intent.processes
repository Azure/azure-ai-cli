INTENT PROCESSES

@speech.include.the.intent.command

  The `--processes` option specifies the maximum number of
  sub-processes to use when parallelizing intent recognition tasks.

  The `--ramp processes every` option can optionally be used to control
  how quickly each new sub-process will be added to the pool. If this option
  is not specified, the default will be 0 ms, and thus the maximum number of
  processes will immediately be available to the pool.

USAGE: ai speech intent [...] --processes NUMBER
   OR: ai speech intent [...] --processes NUMBER --ramp processes every MILLISECONDS

  WHERE: NUMBER represents the maximum number of processes to use/pool
    AND: MILLISECONDS represents the number of milliseconds to wait before
         ... adding each new process

EXAMPLES

  ai speech intent --files @filelist.txt --processes 10
  ai speech intent --files *.wav --processes 20 --ramp processes every 30000
