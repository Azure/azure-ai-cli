CONFIG SCOPE

@include.the.config.command

  @files can exist at multiple SCOPEs of use, across two kinds of SCOPEs:
  (1) REGION specific SCOPEs
  (2) COMMAND specific

  REGION specific SCOPEs enables AI configuration data to vary based on
  what REGION is specified for each ai command. For example, you likely use
  different subscription keys dependent upon what REGION in which your Azure
  AI Service is running.

  COMMAND specific SCOPEs enable AI configuration data to vary based on
  what COMMAND is being used. For example, for `ai chat` commands you may
  want to use one specific ENDPOINT, whereas, for `ai complete` commands you may
  want to use a different ENDPOINT with a PROXY.
