CUSTOM HELPER FUNCTION EXAMPLES

  `EXAMPLE 1`: Create a custom helper function project

    ai dev new helper-functions

    ... which will create a project, with a class, that has a method like this:

      [HelperFunctionDescription("Gets the user's name")]
      public static string GetUsersName()
      {
          return Environment.UserName;
      }

  `EXAMPLE 2`: Create a custom helper function project with LLM instructions

    ai dev new helper-functions --instructions "Return the current date and time as a string"

    ... which will create a project, with a class, that has a method like this:

      [HelperFunctionDescription("Returns the current date and time as a string")]
      public static string GetCurrentDateTime()
      {
          return DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("o");
      }

  `EXAMPLE 3`: Create a custom helper function project with LLM instructions from a file

    Create a file called `instructions.txt` with the following contents:

      `#a_;Create a new class with helper functions that C# process functions that`
      `#a_;can execute the git executable to do anything I want to with git. The new helper`
      `#a_;function should accept a string, and return a string, which is the applications`
      `#a_;combined output from stdout and stderr.`
      
      `#a_;If the caller passes in 'git ' as part of the command, ignore that part.`

    ai dev new helper-functions --instructions @instructions.txt

  `EXAMPLE 4`: Build the helper function project into an assembly

    cd helper-functions
    dotnet build HelperFunctionsProject.csproj

  `EXAMPLE 5`: Use custom helper functions from an assembly
