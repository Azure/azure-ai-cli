SYNTHESIZE FILES

@include.the.synthesize.command

  The `--files` option specifies multiple local data files containing
  text or SSML to be synthesized into audio.

  The `--urls` option specifies multiple local data files containing
  text or SSML to be synthesized into audio after first caching the data
  locally, removing it when done.

USAGE: spx synthesize [...] --urls URL1;URL2[;...]
   OR: spx synthesize [...] --urls @FILELIST.txt
   OR: spx synthesize [...] --files @FILELIST.txt
   OR: spx synthesize [...] --files FILE1;FILE2[;...]
   OR: spx synthesize [...] --files PATTERN
