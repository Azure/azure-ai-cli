INTENT THREADS

@include.the.intent.command

  The `--threads` option specifies a how many threads to use when 
  parallelizing recognition tasks.

  The `--ramp threads every` option can optionally be used to control
  how quickly each new thread will be added to the thread pool. If this option
  is not specified, the default will be 0 ms, and thus the maximum number of
  threads will immediately be available to the pool.

USAGE: spx intent [...] --threads NUMBER
   OR: spx intent [...] --threads NUMBER --ramp threads every MILLISECONDS

  WHERE: NUMBER represents the maximum number of threads to use/pool
    AND: MILLISECONDS represents the number of milliseconds to wait before
         ... adding each new thread

EXAMPLES

  spx intent --files @filelist.txt --threads 10
  spx intent --files *.wav --threads 20 --ramp threads every 30000
