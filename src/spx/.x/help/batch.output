BATCH OUTPUT

  The `spx batch` command manages Azure Speech Service batch operations.

  BATCH DOWNLOAD FILE OUTPUT

    When using `spx batch download` or `spx batch transcription download`, the
    `--output file` option specifies the name of the downloaded file.
    
    Use this option when you want to use a different filename than the default.

    HTTP request into the file specified.

  BATCH RESOURCE REFERENCE OUTPUT - URL or ID

    For the `spx batch` `create` and `status` commands, the `--output url` and
    `--output id` options write the batch resource reference into the SPX
    datastore configuration file specified.
    
    Use this option to chain together multiple batch commands
    in sequence, or to subsequently use the reference
    without parsing the service JSON response.

    in sequence, or to subsequently use the reference
    list without parsing the service JSON response.
