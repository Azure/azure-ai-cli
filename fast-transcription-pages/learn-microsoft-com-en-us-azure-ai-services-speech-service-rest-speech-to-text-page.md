## Speech to Text REST API - Azure AI Services

### Overview
The Speech to Text REST API is part of Azure AI Services, providing capabilities for transcribing audio files into text. This service supports both batch transcription and custom speech functionalities, allowing users to work with audio data efficiently.

### Fast Transcription
Fast transcription is designed to transcribe audio files with results returned synchronously, offering a faster-than-real-time transcription experience. This is particularly useful for scenarios requiring quick audio or video transcription or translation.

#### How It Works
- **API Endpoint**: Use the `/speechtotext/transcriptions:transcribe` endpoint.
- **Parameters**: 
  - **Audio File**: Provide the audio file to be transcribed.
  - **Language**: Specify the language of the audio content.
  - **Model**: Choose a base or custom model for transcription.
- **Outputs**:
  - **Transcript**: Receive the transcribed text.
  - **Latency**: Predictable latency ensures quick turnaround.

### Custom Speech
Custom speech allows the creation and deployment of models tailored to specific datasets or requirements.

#### Features
- **Data Upload**: Upload and manage datasets for training and testing models.
- **Model Training**: Train models using specific datasets to improve accuracy.
- **Endpoint Deployment**: Deploy trained models to custom endpoints for real-time or batch processing.

### Batch Transcription
Batch transcription enables the processing of multiple audio files from URLs or Azure storage containers.

#### Operation Groups
- **Models**: Use either base or custom models for transcription.
- **Transcriptions**: Handle large volumes of audio files by batching requests.
- **Web Hooks**: Register for notifications about transcription events such as creation, processing, and completion.

### Using the API in C#
To integrate the Speech to Text REST API into a C# application, follow these steps:

1. **Authentication**: Obtain an Azure subscription key and endpoint URL.
2. **HTTP Requests**: Use `HttpClient` to send POST requests with the necessary headers (e.g., subscription key, content type).
3. **Request Body**: Include the audio data and configuration parameters in the request body.
4. **Handle Responses**: Parse the JSON response to extract the transcribed text and other relevant data.

### Additional Features
- **Logs**: Access logs for each endpoint if enabled.
- **Storage**: Use Azure storage accounts for data management.
- **Webhooks**: Set up webhooks for real-time notifications on transcription and model events.

### Service Health
Monitor the health of the Speech to Text service and its components through the service health dashboard.

### Next Steps
- **Create a Custom Speech Project**: Set up projects for managing models, datasets, and endpoints.
- **Explore Batch Transcription**: Understand how to handle large-scale audio transcription efficiently.
